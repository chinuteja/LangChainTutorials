      "* **Applications:** AI is transforming industries like healthcare (diagnosis, drug discovery), finance (fraud detection), transportation (self-driving cars), retail (personalized recommendations), education (personalized learning), and manufacturing (predictive maintenance).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Benefits:** AI offers increased efficiency, accuracy, innovation, personalized experiences, and improved safety.\n",
